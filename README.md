# 4-Bit-Prime-Number-Detector
An expandable and dynamic 4-bit prime number detector designed in Proteus


This is a design for a 4 bit prime number detector in proteus. The logic used to create the circuitry is expandable to however many large number needed, however for that the timings of the clocks will have to be tweaked a bit to ensure 100% accurate answers in the divisor
